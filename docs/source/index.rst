Welcome to The 2nd Trial!
=========================

My name is *Andrea*. I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in Applied Mathematics and an equally big interest in solving problems.

I created this project to share knowledge and engage on different topics covering **Science**, **Mathematics**, **Physics**, **Computer Science**, and other branches of **Knowledge**.
Its purpose can be summarized by my motto:

.. epigraph::

   To stay curious,
   To explore,
   To learn,
   And discover that the whole universe,
   can be reduced to one single equation.

   -- Andrea Tino

I post about different topics and without a well defined cadence.
Regardless of what I write about, I always try my best to make my content clear, with a well defined audience, and reproducible. 
The whole project is open source, feel free to engage with me on anything I publish.

What's with the name?
---------------------

The name *2nd Trial* is a reference to the Italian National Exam that students in their last year of high school need to sustain. The exam consists of 3 trials in total, the second being Math. It is considered a real rite of passage |:smile:|.
