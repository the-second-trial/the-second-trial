The Average Shadow Problem series
=================================

This series is about the *Average Shadow* problem. Its formulartion is quite simple and it involves ideal conditions.

An object is positioned on top of a surface, there is a single light source coming straight from the top causing said object to cast a shadow in the underlying surface.
Since the light source is considered to have an infinite distance from the object, the ray lights are all perpendicular to the surface, which simplifies things a lot because the distance between the object and the surface becomes a negligible quantity.

The problem is about evaluate the average area of the shadow casted by the object under all its possible rotations.
