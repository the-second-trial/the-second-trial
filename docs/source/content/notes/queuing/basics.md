# Basic concepts in Queuing Theory

This is the simplest version of the _Average Shadow Problem_. All the conditions are the same as described in the generic formulation, with the following simplifications:

- The object is a line segment of given length $L \in \mathbb{R}$.
- The object rotates on one single plane.
- The shadow is projected onto a line, not a surface.
